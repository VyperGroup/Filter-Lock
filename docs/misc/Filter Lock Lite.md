# Filter Lock Lite

As of now, you can't use Filter Lock on a static site due to technical limitations. However, if Filter Lock is massively successful, I will consider making Filter Lock Lite, which would essentially be cloaked proxy, that shows the decoy page, but hides the elements of the main site by default. When the methods pass, it will "toggle", revealing the actual site and hiding the decoy page. Additionally, a small amount of Filter Lock modes (namely Arc.io Hider and and Auto Text Escaping) will be available, where it would compile your code before it is deployed.
