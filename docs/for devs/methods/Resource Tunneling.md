# Resource tunneling - Developer notes - Proposal

It will involve detecting the filter on the browser (by pinging web app manifest URLs for filter extensions, pinging the local web filter redirect pages, checking the DNS, port scanning, and a lot more), and if that is successful, proxying site resources with SWs over a web streaming protocol (WT/WebRTC Data Channel/WS), which would be encrypted with a different key for each proxy site link. This would be done because extensions can't replicate these types of requests (in the case of request repeating) or monitor them. I'm thinking about encrypting these connections with a XChaCha20 (symmetrical) key that would be unique per proxy site origin. It would deconstruct the request in the SW handler to a raw HTTP request as a message, send that to the server, and on the server that WS message would be parsed and rerouted to the HTML server handler, but instead when the final response is generated it wouldn't be sent to any server, but intercepted and deconstructed back to the SW through a response message, where it would finally be reassembled. Sorting these requests would work kinda like
