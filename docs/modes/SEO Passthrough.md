# SEO Passthrough - Proposal

[Developer notes](../for%20devs/modes/SEO%20Passthrough.md)

To promote SEO, all necessary elements for search crawlers will be present and visible, while withholding any information that is not authorized for the crawler. This includes niche components such as React routes, although functionality will not be included.

The search crawler is detected through its User Agent (UA). It is important to note that this process may open a new vector for detection.
