## For those who want to improve the standard

Please dicuss your proposals [here](https://discord.gg/2zweF7YMub).

## For those interested in developing implementations that conform to the Filter Lock standard

Anything that has to do with modes, however shouldn't be considered standard and rather documentation for my own personal implementations. Sorry for the confusion! If you are interested in writing your own implements, please don't worry about have to implement any of these optional modes or extra specifications, such as Double-layer TLS and Resource Tunneling. A basic implementation is fine enough right now. In this repo, there are many implementations of it present in src.
