# Filter Lock

Filter Lock is a standard for HTTP Router Middleware that makes your links nearly unblockable and prevents automatic blocking and helps to prevent manual blocks.

Please see the [documentation](./docs/README.md)

> The official JS implementation can be found in src/. Anything you see there will most likely change because the code is not finished yet. Don't attempt to use it. Not even the TODO's or docs are fully completed yet and some are outdated!

The best way to use Filter Lock is to reserve a certain % of your links to be Link Bot Locked and the rest to use Filter Testing. Also have demo links for those who aren't subject to filtering or to a lesser extent.
