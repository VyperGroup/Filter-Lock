# Filter Lock

> The official JS implementation can be found in src/. Anything you see there will most likely change because the code is not finished yet. Don't attempt to use it. Not even the TODO's or docs are fully completed yet and some are outdated!

Filter Lock is a standard makes your links nearly unblockable and prevents automatic blocking and helps to prevent manual blocks. It works through HTTP Router Middleware.

The best way to use Filter Lock is to reserve a certain % of your links to be Link Bot Locked and the rest to use Filter Testing. Also have demo links for those who aren't subject to filtering or to a lesser extent.

Please see the [documentation](./docs/README.md)
